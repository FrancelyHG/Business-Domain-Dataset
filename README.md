# Business-Domain-Dataset
I got this dataset through Finance-vix and it includes a collection of data over time, specifically for the VIX, which tracks market volatility.
VIX is a time-series dataset that includes daily data points for its opening, closing, high, and low values. Established in 1993, the VIX serves as a critical indicator of market expectations regarding near-term volatility. This dataset is useful for the Business domain because companies can use the VIX to gauge assess the risk associated with investments. A high VIX value typically indicates heightened market uncertainty and potential volatility, prompting businesses to adjust their risk management strategies.
